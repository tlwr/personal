This is a post about doing bad things in order to do good things, using a BOSH
release.

## BOSH

## Requirements

This work was done on the infrastructure for [GOV.UK
PaaS](https://www.cloud.service.gov.uk/), whilst we were working on the single
sign-on feature.  The bosh release source code is now open and can be found
[here](https://github.com/alphagov/paas-uaa-customized-boshrelease), and is
heavily based on an [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/) [BOSH
release](https://github.com/18F/uaa-customized-boshrelease).
